# VERIFY_RELEASE.md — `cpm-engine` v2.9.41 Forensic Verification Packet

This document is the **courtroom-exhibit-form** of the engine release verification chain. Cite **this file**, the **Sigstore-signed witness** attached to the [v2.9.41 release](https://github.com/danafitkowski/cpp-cpm-engine/releases/tag/v2.9.41), and the [DAUBERT.md](DAUBERT.md) disclosure together — that triad is the engine's reliability record under FRE 702 / Daubert Prong 1 (testability).

> **Status:** v2.9.41, a disclosure and parity-coverage release: engine math is unchanged from v2.9.40 (the three F20/F21/F27 alert-parity carve-outs were retired, growing executed cross-validation from 925 of 989 to 931 of 995, and the fabricated actual-start-pinning citation withdrawal shipped). v2.9.40 was the P6 23.12 alignment wave. Engine math changed there from v2.9.38 and is no longer byte-identical to v2.9.27, v2.9.28, v2.9.29. Five behaviors moved in `cpm-engine.js` and `python_reference/cpm.py` (commits `264de84`, `bf442d5`, `05dc8b4`, all 2026-08-11): open-end backward seeding now takes the project-finish instant on each activity's own calendar rather than a scalar max-EF; SS and SF successors bound the predecessor's `LS` only and no longer re-add its duration to bound `LF`; `MS_Finish` / `MFO` pins both ends, with `ES` back-computed from the `EF` pin on the activity's own calendar; under the default `retained_logic` mode the remaining work of an in-progress activity restarts at max(data date, driving predecessor logic); and published free float floors at zero, with the signed forensic value carried in `ff_signed` / `ff_signed_working_days`. See [DAUBERT.md §8](DAUBERT.md#8-constraint-handling-v2912). The Sigstore witness chain is regenerated on each tagged release.

## What this file proves

Anyone — opposing counsel, an opposing expert, an academic auditor — can independently confirm, **without trusting Critical Path Partners**, that:

1. The `cpm-engine.js` source at commit `<commit_sha>` matches the SHA-256 below.
2. The `python_reference/cpm.py` source at the same commit matches the SHA-256 below.
3. The Sigstore-signed witness JSON published on the GitHub release was produced by GitHub Actions infrastructure (not the proponent's laptop), signed via GitHub OIDC, and logged to the public Rekor transparency log.
4. Running the verification suite on the verifier's own machine reproduces the same test counts, crossval counts, and SHA-256 hashes.

What it does **not** prove: that the engine produces correct CPM dates for every conceivable schedule. That is what the unit tests, crossval, and the [DAUBERT.md](DAUBERT.md) §3.1 Independent Verification section address. This file documents the *integrity chain*, not the *correctness* claim.

## Release manifest — v2.9.41

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Tag | `v2.9.41` |
| Commit SHA | `af9808f414b65424ebc068105efbe1439a1c82de` |
| Release date | 2026-08-19 |
| Engine source | `cpm-engine.js` |
| Engine SHA-256 | computed at attestation time; mirrored in the per-release `release-evidence/v<TAG>/cpm-engine.js.sha256` (the top-level `cpm-engine.js.sha256` is **gitignored** per `scripts/attestation.js` — it is a per-machine regenerated artifact, not a committed pin). |
| Python reference | `python_reference/cpm.py` |
| Python reference SHA-256 | computed at attestation time; mirrored in the per-release `release-evidence/v<TAG>/python_reference-cpm.py.sha256` (the top-level `python_reference/cpm.py.sha256` is **gitignored** for the same reason — generated artifact, not committed pin). |
| Witness JSON (release asset) | `attestations/latest.json` on [the v2.9.41 release page](https://github.com/danafitkowski/cpp-cpm-engine/releases/tag/v2.9.41) |
| Unit tests | 1,134 / 1,134 passing |
| Cross-validation | 931 of 995 enumerated comparisons bit-identical across 45 fixtures, 0 deviations. The harness prints `Checks: 931 / 931` because its denominator is the executed count: 64 comparisons on the enumerated surface (61 `ff_signed_working_days`, 3 `ff_signed`) are skipped by the field guards wherever one side emits no value, and are excluded from both the numerator and the denominator. 58 of the 64 are substantive, the Python reference not assigning `ff_signed_working_days` on the has-successors path; the remaining 6 are representation-only, on completed activities where neither engine emits the field (see [DAUBERT.md §3.1](DAUBERT.md#31-independent-verification)) |
| Branch coverage | 82.44% (1,836 / 2,227 branches); see [DAUBERT.md §2.1](DAUBERT.md#21-test-coverage-v2939-baseline) |
| Statement coverage | 93.10% (8,373 / 8,993 statements) |
| Citation regression | PASS |
| `npm run verify` verdict | PASS |

The two SHA-256 hashes are the **anchor** of the integrity chain. They are regenerated on every `npm run attest` and written to `cpm-engine.js.sha256` and `python_reference/cpm.py.sha256` in the repository tree. They are also embedded inside the Sigstore-signed witness JSON.

---

## Layer 1 — Verify the source code SHA-256

This is the cheapest verification step. It does not require the verifier to trust Critical Path Partners or GitHub.

```bash
# Clone the repository at the tagged commit
git clone https://github.com/danafitkowski/cpp-cpm-engine
cd cpp-cpm-engine
git checkout v2.9.41

# Compute the SHA-256 of the engine source
shasum -a 256 cpm-engine.js
# Expected: <engine_sha> from the release manifest above

# Compute the SHA-256 of the Python reference
shasum -a 256 python_reference/cpm.py
# Expected: <python_sha> from the release manifest above
```

**What this proves.** The bytes in your clone match the bytes the project says it released. Any tampering between the GitHub-hosted repository and the verifier's machine would surface as a hash mismatch.

**What this does not prove.** That those bytes are correct CPM code. That requires running the verification suite (Layer 3) or independent peer review.

---

## Layer 2 — Verify the Sigstore-signed witness

This is the cryptographic integrity layer. The verifier confirms that the witness JSON was signed by GitHub Actions infrastructure at the tagged release moment, not by the proponent's laptop after the fact.

### Download the witness

```bash
# From the GitHub release page, download attestations/latest.json
# (it is attached as a release asset, not committed to the repo tree)
gh release download v2.9.41 \
    --repo danafitkowski/cpp-cpm-engine \
    --pattern "attestations-latest.json"
```

### Verify the Sigstore signature

```bash
gh attestation verify attestations-latest.json \
    --owner danafitkowski

# Expected output (paraphrased):
#   ✓ Verification succeeded!
#   The following predicate types were found:
#       - https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1
#   This attestation was signed by:
#       - workflow: .github/workflows/verify.yml
#       - repo: danafitkowski/cpp-cpm-engine
#       - issuer: https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
```

**What this proves.** The witness was signed by GitHub Actions running under the project's own workflow file (`.github/workflows/verify.yml`) at the tagged release moment. The signature is recorded on the public Sigstore transparency log (Rekor) and cannot be forged after the fact without leaving an audit trail.

### Look up the Rekor entry directly

```bash
# Open the Rekor transparency log search:
#   https://search.sigstore.dev/?logIndex=<index>
# The logIndex is included in the attestation metadata. Alternatively,
# query by hash or by certificate fingerprint:
rekor-cli search --sha256 <engine_sha_from_manifest>
```

Any third party can follow the Rekor URL and confirm the witness exists in the public log, was signed at the documented timestamp, and was issued for this repository under the GitHub OIDC issuer. **The transparency log is not under the proponent's control.**

---

## Layer 3 — Reproduce the verification suite on your own machine

This is the strongest verification step. The verifier ignores all of the proponent's machinery and runs the entire test suite + crossval + citation regression + attestation script on their own hardware.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18 (the engine has **zero runtime dependencies** — no npm install needed for runtime)
- Python 3.10+ (for the JS↔Python crossval)
- `c8` as a devDependency (auto-installed by `npm install`, for coverage reporting only)

### Run the full verification

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danafitkowski/cpp-cpm-engine
cd cpp-cpm-engine
git checkout v2.9.41

# Optional — install c8 devDep for coverage reporting
npm install --no-save

# Run the full verification suite
npm run verify
```

### Expected output

```
=== cpm-engine verification ===
package version:  2.9.41
engine.sha256:    <engine_sha from manifest>
python_ref.sha256: <python_sha from manifest>

[1/3] unit tests
  1134 passed, 0 failed

[2/3] cross-validation
  Fixtures: 45 passed, 0 failed
  Checks:   931 / 931

[3/3] citation regression
  PASS

Verdict: PASS

Witness written to: attestations/latest.json
```

**What this proves.** The verifier's machine reproduces the same SHA-256 hashes, the same 1,134 / 931 pass counts, and the same PASS verdict — without any code from the proponent running at verification time other than the source files the verifier just downloaded and hashed.

**Drift documents itself.** Any mismatch — different SHA, different pass count, different verdict — is itself usable evidence. The verifier can publish a witness from their own machine showing the drift; it is the same JSON shape as the proponent's witness.

---

## Layer 4 — Independent verification, where the verifier owns the inputs too

Layers 1-3 verify the engine against itself. The next layer — outside the proponent's control — is independent reproduction by a third party who runs the engine against **their own** schedule inputs and confirms the outputs are consistent with their independent expectations (e.g., Primavera P6 native float values, MS Project schedule dates, or a hand-computed CPM walk).

This packet does **not** yet include a third-party reproduction memo from an outside scheduler / programmer / academic. The single biggest credibility step beyond Layers 1-3 is a signed Layer 4 attestation; pursuit of that attestation is on the [DAUBERT.md §10 roadmap](DAUBERT.md#10-roadmap--forward-looking-daubert-hardening).

What an opposing expert can do **today** without waiting for that memo: clone v2.9.41, run `npm run verify`, run the engine against three or four of their own P6 schedule exports, compare outputs to P6 native values field-by-field, and either confirm or document the discrepancy. The engine's source is open and the verification surface is one command.

---

## What this packet does **not** claim

- It does not claim the engine produces results "identical to Primavera P6" outside the disclosed comparison surface. The disclosed P6 surface is the 13-case matrix at [`validation/p6-comparison/`](validation/p6-comparison/), which reads 13 / 13 against a single Primavera P6 23.12 capture; two further by-construction divergence cases are excluded and documented in [`validation/engine-limitations/`](validation/engine-limitations/). That 13 / 13 is fitted, not held out: the capture first scored 6 PASS / 7 FAIL, the engine was then corrected against it, and no second independent capture exists. The capture sheet is gitignored, so a clean clone cannot regenerate the matrix, though the per-case `comparison.csv` files do carry the P6 columns.
- It does not claim "zero error rate" in any general sense. The §4 framing is explicit: 0% **observed** mismatch on the disclosed validation suite, not a general error-rate claim. See [DAUBERT.md §4](DAUBERT.md#4-error-rate).
- It does not claim Bayesian / kinematic surfaces are bit-identical with the Python reference. Those surfaces are JS-only; see [DAUBERT.md §11](DAUBERT.md).
- It does not claim peer-reviewed status. The engine has not been peer-reviewed in a journal; [DAUBERT.md §3](DAUBERT.md#3-peer-review) discloses this.
- It does not claim "court-admissible by itself." The engine supports an expert's methodology disclosure; admissibility under FRE 702 / Daubert remains the expert's burden under the four-prong framework, applied to the specific opinion being offered.
