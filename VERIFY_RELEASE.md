# VERIFY_RELEASE.md — `cpm-engine` v2.9.46 Forensic Verification Packet

This document is the **courtroom-exhibit-form** of the engine release verification chain. Cite **this file**, the **Sigstore-signed witness** attached to the [v2.9.46 release](https://github.com/danafitkowski/cpp-cpm-engine/releases/tag/v2.9.46), and the [DAUBERT.md](DAUBERT.md) disclosure together — that triad is the engine's reliability record under FRE 702 / Daubert Prong 1 (testability).

> **Status:** v2.9.46, an engine-math release. Under retained logic, P6 does not stop scheduling at a COMPLETED activity: it schedules the completed activity like any other, with zero remaining duration, so a completed activity that is itself out of sequence (its own predecessor still unfinished) carries that predecessor's date on to its successors. Both ports previously skipped a completed node outright, so the unfinished predecessor's finish died at the first completed activity on the path and everything downstream floated free at the data date. Paired in the same wave: an SS/SF successor of a started, incomplete predecessor now drives from `max(actual_start + lag, restart)` rather than the restart alone (SS_U), and `progress_override`'s restart anchor now snaps forward off a non-working data-date instant the same way `retained_logic`'s already has since v2.9.43 (PO_SNAP). A result computed on v2.9.45 or earlier can differ on a completed-out-of-sequence network or on any SS/SF successor of a started predecessor, so a deliverable already issued from an earlier tagged build is inside the supersession window and needs the re-check step in the operator procedure. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the measurements behind the change (a 503-activity real schedule read back from the P6 database).


## What this file proves

Anyone — opposing counsel, an opposing expert, an academic auditor — can independently confirm, **without trusting Critical Path Partners**, that:

1. The `cpm-engine.js` source at commit `<commit_sha>` matches the SHA-256 below.
2. The `python_reference/cpm.py` source at the same commit matches the SHA-256 below.
3. The Sigstore-signed witness JSON published on the GitHub release was produced by GitHub Actions infrastructure (not the proponent's laptop), signed via GitHub OIDC, and logged to the public Rekor transparency log.
4. Running the verification suite on the verifier's own machine reproduces the same test counts, crossval counts, and SHA-256 hashes.

What it does **not** prove: that the engine produces correct CPM dates for every conceivable schedule. That is what the unit tests, crossval, and the [DAUBERT.md](DAUBERT.md) §3.1 Independent Verification section address. This file documents the *integrity chain*, not the *correctness* claim.

## Release manifest — v2.9.46

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Tag | `v2.9.46` |
| Commit SHA | `03611f40b54c3dfb1cdbd082beb2721302404c70` |
| Release date | 2026-09-22 |
| Engine source | `cpm-engine.js` |
| Engine SHA-256 | computed at attestation time; mirrored in the per-release `release-evidence/v<TAG>/cpm-engine.js.sha256` (the top-level `cpm-engine.js.sha256` is **gitignored** per `scripts/attestation.js` — it is a per-machine regenerated artifact, not a committed pin). |
| Python reference | `python_reference/cpm.py` |
| Python reference SHA-256 | computed at attestation time; mirrored in the per-release `release-evidence/v<TAG>/python_reference-cpm.py.sha256` (the top-level `python_reference/cpm.py.sha256` is **gitignored** for the same reason — generated artifact, not committed pin). |
| Witness JSON (release asset) | `attestations/latest.json` on [the v2.9.46 release page](https://github.com/danafitkowski/cpp-cpm-engine/releases/tag/v2.9.46) |
| Unit tests | 1,307 / 1,307 passing |
| Cross-validation | 1167 of 1183 enumerated comparisons bit-identical across 53 fixtures, 0 deviations. The harness prints `Checks: 1167 / 1167` because its denominator is the executed count: 16 comparisons on the enumerated surface (8 `ff_signed`, 8 `ff_signed_working_days`) are skipped by the field guards, all on completed activities where NEITHER engine emits the field, so none is an open port gap. The 58 one-sided skips that were open port gaps closed when the has-successors branch was ported (see [DAUBERT.md §3.1](DAUBERT.md#31-independent-verification)) |
| Branch coverage | 82.63% (2,156 / 2,609 branches), measured on the v2.9.46 bytes 2026-09-22; see [DAUBERT.md §2.1](DAUBERT.md#21-test-coverage-v2946-baseline) |
| Statement coverage | 93.81% (10,128 / 10,796 statements), same §2.1 baseline measurement |
| Citation regression | PASS |
| `npm run verify` verdict | PASS |

The two SHA-256 hashes are the **anchor** of the integrity chain. They are regenerated on every `npm run attest` and written to `cpm-engine.js.sha256` and `python_reference/cpm.py.sha256` in the repository tree. They are also embedded inside the Sigstore-signed witness JSON.

---

## Layer 1 — Verify the source code SHA-256

This is the cheapest verification step. It does not require the verifier to trust Critical Path Partners or GitHub.

```bash
# Clone the repository at the tagged commit
git clone https://github.com/danafitkowski/cpp-cpm-engine
cd cpp-cpm-engine
git checkout v2.9.46

# Compute the SHA-256 of the engine source
shasum -a 256 cpm-engine.js
# Expected: <engine_sha> from the release manifest above

# Compute the SHA-256 of the Python reference
shasum -a 256 python_reference/cpm.py
# Expected: <python_sha> from the release manifest above
```

**What this proves.** The bytes in your clone match the bytes the project says it released. Any tampering between the GitHub-hosted repository and the verifier's machine would surface as a hash mismatch.

**What this does not prove.** That those bytes are correct CPM code. That requires running the verification suite (Layer 3) or independent peer review.

---

## Layer 2 — Verify the Sigstore-signed witness

This is the cryptographic integrity layer. The verifier confirms that the witness JSON was signed by GitHub Actions infrastructure at the tagged release moment, not by the proponent's laptop after the fact.

### Download the witness

```bash
# From the GitHub release page, download attestations/latest.json
# (it is attached as a release asset, not committed to the repo tree;
# the asset is named `latest.json`)
gh release download v2.9.46 \
    --repo danafitkowski/cpp-cpm-engine \
    --pattern "latest.json"
```

### Verify the Sigstore signature

```bash
gh attestation verify latest.json \
    --owner danafitkowski

# Expected output (paraphrased):
#   ✓ Verification succeeded!
#   The following predicate types were found:
#       - https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1
#   This attestation was signed by:
#       - workflow: .github/workflows/verify.yml
#       - repo: danafitkowski/cpp-cpm-engine
#       - issuer: https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
```

**What this proves.** The witness was signed by GitHub Actions running under the project's own workflow file (`.github/workflows/verify.yml`) at the tagged release moment. The signature is recorded on the public Sigstore transparency log (Rekor) and cannot be forged after the fact without leaving an audit trail.

### Look up the Rekor entry directly

```bash
# Open the Rekor transparency log search:
#   https://search.sigstore.dev/?logIndex=<index>
# The logIndex is included in the attestation metadata. Alternatively,
# query by hash or by certificate fingerprint:
rekor-cli search --sha256 <engine_sha_from_manifest>
```

Any third party can follow the Rekor URL and confirm the witness exists in the public log, was signed at the documented timestamp, and was issued for this repository under the GitHub OIDC issuer. **The transparency log is not under the proponent's control.**

---

## Layer 3 — Reproduce the verification suite on your own machine

This is the strongest verification step. The verifier ignores all of the proponent's machinery and runs the entire test suite + crossval + citation regression + attestation script on their own hardware.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18 (the engine has **zero runtime dependencies** — no npm install needed for runtime)
- Python 3.10+ (for the JS↔Python crossval)
- `c8` as a devDependency (auto-installed by `npm install`, for coverage reporting only)

### Run the full verification

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danafitkowski/cpp-cpm-engine
cd cpp-cpm-engine
git checkout v2.9.46

# Optional — install c8 devDep for coverage reporting
npm install --no-save

# Run the full verification suite
npm run verify
```

### Expected output

```
=== cpm-engine verification ===
package version:  2.9.46
engine.sha256:    <engine_sha from manifest>
python_ref.sha256: <python_sha from manifest>

[1/3] unit tests
  1307 passed, 0 failed

[2/3] cross-validation
  Fixtures: 46 passed, 0 failed
  Checks:   1167 / 1167

[3/3] citation regression
  PASS

Verdict: PASS

Witness written to: attestations/latest.json
```

**What this proves.** The verifier's machine reproduces the same SHA-256 hashes, the same 1,307 / 1167 pass counts, and the same PASS verdict — without any code from the proponent running at verification time other than the source files the verifier just downloaded and hashed.

**Drift documents itself.** Any mismatch — different SHA, different pass count, different verdict — is itself usable evidence. The verifier can publish a witness from their own machine showing the drift; it is the same JSON shape as the proponent's witness.

---

## Layer 4 — Independent verification, where the verifier owns the inputs too

Layers 1-3 verify the engine against itself. The next layer — outside the proponent's control — is independent reproduction by a third party who runs the engine against **their own** schedule inputs and confirms the outputs are consistent with their independent expectations (e.g., Primavera P6 native float values, MS Project schedule dates, or a hand-computed CPM walk).

This packet does **not** yet include a third-party reproduction memo from an outside scheduler / programmer / academic. The single biggest credibility step beyond Layers 1-3 is a signed Layer 4 attestation; pursuit of that attestation is on the [DAUBERT.md §10 roadmap](DAUBERT.md#10-roadmap--forward-looking-daubert-hardening).

What an opposing expert can do **today** without waiting for that memo: clone v2.9.46, run `npm run verify`, run the engine against three or four of their own P6 schedule exports, compare outputs to P6 native values field-by-field, and either confirm or document the discrepancy. The engine's source is open and the verification surface is one command.

---

## What this packet does **not** claim

- It does not claim the engine produces results "identical to Primavera P6" outside the disclosed comparison surface. The disclosed P6 surface is the 13-case matrix at [`validation/p6-comparison/`](validation/p6-comparison/), which reads 13 / 13 against a single Primavera P6 23.12 capture; two further by-construction divergence cases are excluded and documented in [`validation/engine-limitations/`](validation/engine-limitations/). That 13 / 13 is fitted, not held out: the capture first scored 6 PASS / 7 FAIL, the engine was then corrected against it, and no second independent capture exists. The capture sheet is gitignored, so a clean clone cannot regenerate the matrix, though the per-case `comparison.csv` files do carry the P6 columns.
- It does not claim "zero error rate" in any general sense. The §4 framing is explicit: 0% **observed** mismatch on the disclosed validation suite, not a general error-rate claim. See [DAUBERT.md §4](DAUBERT.md#4-error-rate).
- It does not claim Bayesian / kinematic surfaces are bit-identical with the Python reference. Those surfaces are JS-only; see [DAUBERT.md §11](DAUBERT.md).
- It does not claim peer-reviewed status. The engine has not been peer-reviewed in a journal; [DAUBERT.md §3](DAUBERT.md#3-peer-review) discloses this.
- It does not claim "court-admissible by itself." The engine supports an expert's methodology disclosure; admissibility under FRE 702 / Daubert remains the expert's burden under the four-prong framework, applied to the specific opinion being offered.
